description: An unwarranted exploration of deconstructing skateboards.
full: "DECKS is a website and ongoing playful deconstruction of the skateboard, and how far its definition can be pushed. It features masterpieces of human suggestion, such as a Toilet deck, a Crowbar deck, and many more. For those who are interested in adding to the project, there is a blank schematic and suggestion page to submit new deck ideas. <br><br>Made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript."
