description: A visual identity made for a community of plant stores in NYC.
full: I happened to stumble across this street on a whim. I passed by 28th and saw the abundance of greenery, and immediately had to go explore. The identity is based on the variety of typefaces seen throughout the street, and how they can be used together with the Helvetica Neue to create a uniquely "New York" feel to this space. <br><br>Made with Adobe Illustrator.
